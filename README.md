# PandemUI
UI for our Final Year Project 'PANDEM' :art:

## How to use it
1. Create a folder with your name like **Mathew** in the `dist\utils\labelled images` directory.
1. Place two of your face pictures in your *name labelled* folder. (Preferably .jpg images)
1. Name those images as **1.jpg** and **2.jpg**
1. Then just run `npm run dev` in the cmd and hopefully it should work :v:
